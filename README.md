*An overview of some of the projects I've been working on.*

**In modern-day competitive business landscape, employee retention is paramount for organizational success. High turnover rates can lead to increased recruitment costs, loss of institutional knowledge, and decreased productivity. The Attrition Analysis project for this company aimed to identify key factors contributing to employee attrition and provide actionable insights to mitigate turnover risks.

The project involved a comprehensive analysis of employee data, including but not limited to demographic information, job roles, performance metrics, compensation, and tenure. By leveraging advanced statistical techniques, I was able to uncover patterns and trends associated with attrition within the organization.
